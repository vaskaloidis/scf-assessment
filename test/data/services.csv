The path from Old Campus Quad to Harkness Tower fails to meet that definition.. Although the BOA was foolish enough to sell the rest of High Street, this portion still remains public property and should not be commandeered by the University.\n\nIssue: Yale has also taken it upon themselves to tamp a large pile of asphalt on the Harkness side of the street sloping from street to sidewalk. Although this resembled a handicap ramp, it fails to actually meet the ADA definition, is the inversion of a curb cut extending out into the street and therefore puts vehicles in grave danger.
